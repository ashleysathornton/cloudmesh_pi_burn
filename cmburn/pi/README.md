# cm-pi-burn

WARNING: This program is designed for a Raspberry Pi and must not be
executed on your laptop

## Setup a Master Raspberry Pi

We recommend that you install first on one Raspberry pi the full
operating system. Please consult with the manuals on how to burn your SD
card.

Download the latest Raspbian Desktop image from
<https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/raspbian/> and unzip it to get a
`.img` file. Insert a SD card into your computer and burn it with this
image using a program like Etcher.

Once you have achieved that and configured the OS (dont forget to use a
strong password) you need to update it after the customary reboot.

Make sure your time is set up properly, which you can do with 

```bash
$ sudo date -s "Dec 2, 2019 14:03 EST"
```

and put in the appropriate time string corresponding to your date and
time and time zone.

Now, open a terminal and execute 

```bash
    $sudo apt-get update
    $sudo apt-get full-upgrade
```

Now you have to create an ssh key with the command

```bash
    ssh-keygen
```

Keep the default location and use a strong passphrase. Using no
passphrase is not recommended. You can use `ssh-add` in a terminal so
you do not have to all the time type in your passphrase. Please consult
with the manual on `ssh-keygen` and `ssh-add`.

## Activate python 3

Next configure python 3 with the help of a virtual env

```bash
    $python3 -m venv ~/ENV3
    $source ~/ENV3/bin/activate
```

Place at the end of your `.bashrc` file the line

```
source ~/ENV3/bin/activate
```
 
Now open a new terminal and see if it has the `(ENV3)` as a prefix to
your command prompt.

If this is the case close all the other windows and use the terminal you
just started.


## Installation

First you must install cm-pi-burn. In a future version this will be done with 

```bash
$ pip install cloudmesh-cmburn
```
   
However in the meanwhile you do it as follows:

```bash
$ mkdir cm
$ cd cm
$ git clone https://github.com/cloudmesh/cloudmesh_pi_burn.git
$ cd cm-burn
$ pip install -e .
```    

In future we will remove the -e

    $ pip install .

## Information about the SD Cards and Card Writer

You will need at least one SD Card writer. However, cm-pi-burn is
supposed to work also with an USB hub in which you can plug in
multiple SD Cards and burn one card at a time. Once done you can add a
new batch and you can continue writing. This is done for all specified
hosts so that you can minimize the interaction with the SD cards.

To find out more about the Card writers and the SD Cards, you can use
the command

```bash
$ cm-pi-burn detect
```

It will first ask you to not plug in the SDCard writer to probe the
system in empty status. Then you need to plug in the SD Card writer
and with the cards in it. After you have said yes once you plugged
them in, you will see an output similar to: 

```

Is the reader removed? (Y/n) 
Now plug in the Reader ...

Bus 001 Device 016: ID 05e3:0749 Genesys Logic, Inc. 
Bus 002 Device 023: ID 05e3:0749 Genesys Logic, Inc. 
Bus 002 Device 019: ID 045b:0210 Hitachi, Ltd 
Bus 002 Device 021: ID 05e3:0749 Genesys Logic, Inc. 
Bus 002 Device 022: ID 05e3:0749 Genesys Logic, Inc. 
```

Note that in this case we will see two devices, one for the USB hub in
which the card is plugged in, and one for the SD Card itself.

Next we like to show you a bit more useful information while probing
the operating system when the SD Card  Writers are plugged in. Please
call the command:

```bash
$ cm-pi-burn info
```

You will see an output similar to 

```

```

Under Operating system you will see the block device you will see
information about your operating system. This it the card plugged into
the back of your PI.

Under SDCards found you will see the list of SD Cards and some
information about the cards that are plugged into the writers.

Make sure that you only include cards that you truly want to
overwrite. We have give an example where this is not the case while
indicating it in the Empty column. We recommend that you only use
formatted cards so you are sure you do not by accident delete infprmation.

## ROOT

For the burn process you need to use root priviledges. To achieve this
you need to execute the following commands. The source command
activates the python virtual env that you have created where you
installed the cm-pi-burn command

```bash
$ sudo su
# source /home/pi/ENV3/bin/activate
```

Please note that for our notation a `#` indicates this command is
executed in root.

## Finding Image Versions

First you have to find the raspbian image you like to install. For this
purpose we have developed a command that lists you the available images
in the Raspberry Pi repository. To see the versions, please use the command

```bash
# cm-pi-burn image versions
```

Once in a while they come out with new versions. You can refersh the list with

```bash
# cm-pi-burn image versions --refresh
```

## Downloading an Image

To download the newest image, use the command

```bash
# cm-pi-burn image get latest
```

The image is downloaded into the folder

* `~/.cloudmesh/cmburn/images`

To list the downloaded images you can use the command

```bash
# cm-pi-burn image ls
```

In case you like to use the latest download, you can use the
command. You can also specify the exact URL with 

```bash
# cm-pi-burn image get https://downloads.raspberrypi.org/raspbian_lite/images/raspbian_lite-2019-09-30/2019-09-26-raspbian-buster-lite.zip
```

## Creating Cluster SD-Cards

Next we describe how we create a number of SD-Cards to create a cluster.
Each card will have a unique hostname, an ipaddress and you public key. 
To locate your device you can use:

```
$sudo fdisk -l

```
or the more convinient option would be to use the

```
$cm-pi-burn info  
```

You can look at the names of your devices under the device column. Eg /dev/sda,/dev/sdb,etc

## Burning SD-Cards

To burn one card, we will use ` cm-pi-burn create ` with several important options:
* `--image` specifies the name of the image to burn
* `--device` is the path to the SD card. If this option is ommitted, then `cm-pi-burn` will use the devices listed under `cm-pi-burn info`
* `--hostname` is the name for the pi
* `--sshkey` is the path to your SSH PUBLIC key
* `--blocksize` specified to 4M for our purposes
* `--ssid` specifies the name of the wireless network you may wish to connect to
* `--wifipsk` is the password (if one is needed) for the network specified by --ssid

If you want to specify a password for desktop login (for debugging purposes), you can use the option

* `--passwd=PASSWD` 

to set a password. 
In the future, you should not use this option as we do not want to login through the terminal. We only want to SSH from the master Pi

### Auto Format to FAT32
The `--format` is an option that can be used to automatically format your SD card to FAT32. The current implementation is quite unstable as it
makes several assumptions. If this option is used, it will most likely work. 

Do not worry if you see the message `No partition is defined yet!`

### Note on using a static IP address
You can use the `--ipaddr=IP` option to set a static IP address for your Pis. To make sure this works, ensure that your master Pi is connected to the network as cm-pi-burn will pull information from the network to configure static IP usage.

For more information on options, see `/cmburn/pi/cmpiburn.py`

Here is an example call of the command `create` using a static IP address connecting to a home wifi network

```
# cm-pi-burn create \
    --image=2020-02-05-raspbian-buster-lite \
    --device=/dev/sda \
    --hostname=red2 \
    --sshkey=/home/pi/.ssh/id_rsa.pub \
    --blocksize=4M \
    --ssid=HomeNetwork \
    --wifipsk=MyWifiPasswd \
    --ipaddr=10.1.1.30 \
    --format
```

Here we are assuming that your device name is sda but its very important to verify it once before executing the above command.
Note that if we omit the `--device` option, then `cm-pi-burn` will refer to the devices listed using `cm-pi-burn info`

If your Pis are going to use ethernet connection, then the command is as simple as:

```
# cm-pi-burn create \
    --image=2020-02-05-raspbian-buster-lite \
    --device=/dev/sda \
    --hostname=red2 \
    --sshkey=/home/pi/.ssh/id_rsa.pub \
    --blocksize=4M \
    --ipaddr=10.1.1.30 \
    --format
```

To burn many cards you can specify them conveniently in parameter
notation in  the `--hostname` and `--ipaddr` arguments:

```
# cm-pi-burn create \
    --image=2020-02-05-raspbian-buster-lite \
    --device=/dev/sd[a-f]
    --hostname=red[2-7] \
    --sshkey=/home/pi/.ssh/id_rsa.pub 
    --blocksize=4M
    --ssid=HomeNetwork \
    --wifipsk=MyWifiPasswd \
    --ipaddr=10.1.1.[32-37] \
    --format
```

Alternatively, we can ommit the --device option and allow cm-pi-burn to detect the devices from `cm-pi-burn info`:

```
# cm-pi-burn create \
    --image=2020-02-05-raspbian-buster-lite \
    --hostname=red[2-7] \
    --sshkey=/home/pi/.ssh/id_rsa.pub 
    --blocksize=4M
    --ssid=HomeNetwork \
    --wifipsk=MyWifiPasswd \
    --ipaddr=10.1.1.[32-37] \
    --format
```


You may see the program output some unmount errors during the burn process -
this is normal.

After the process is completed, a message will appear on your terminal stating the number of cards you have burnt.

You can verify if the burn process is completed or not by plugging in one of the SD cards to a raspberry pi and starting it. Raspberry Pi terminal appears asking your login and password. After the sucessfull authentication, now you can use your raspberry pi just like any other.


Here is an alternative version to the command above with a different --device option.


```
# cm-pi-burn create \
    --image=2020-02-05-raspbian-buster-lite \
    --device=/dev/sda \
    --hostname=red[2-7] \
    --sshkey=/home/pi/.ssh/id_rsa.pub 
    --blocksize=4M
    --ssid=HomeNetwork \
    --wifipsk=MyWifiPasswd \
    --ipaddr=10.1.1.[32-37] \
    --format
```
Notice here how we have only listed one port in the --device option. This would be in the case that we only have one SD card writer, but we don't want to
rerun the command each time. That would be quite tedious. Instead, the command will burn to /dev/sda with hostname red2, then a prompt will come up asking the user if we want to reuse /dev/sda. 
```
Slot /dev/sda needs to be reused. Do you wish to continue? [y/n] 
# y
Insert next card and press enter...
# [enter]
Burning next card...

```
In this way, we avoid having to rerun the command while providing enough safeguards so we don't accidentally overwrite the last SD card. This prompt will also appear if the number of hosts (in this example there are 4 hosts) exceeds the number of available devices (1 in this example). 

If the only device listed uner `cm-pi-burn info` is /dev/sda, then the above command is equivalent to: 
```

# cm-pi-burn create \
    --image=2020-02-05-raspbian-buster-lite \
    --hostname=red[2-7] \
    --sshkey=/home/pi/.ssh/id_rsa.pub 
    --blocksize=4M
    --ssid=HomeNetwork \
    --wifipsk=MyWifiPasswd \
    --ipaddr=10.1.1.[32-37] \
    --format
```


## From the raspberry FAQ

Quote:
    There is no on/off switch! To switch on, just plug it in. To switch off,
    if you are in the graphical environment, you can either log out from the
    main menu, exit to the Bash prompt, or open the terminal. From the Bash
    prompt or terminal you can shut down the Raspberry Pi by entering sudo
    halt -h. Wait until all the LEDs except the power LED are off, then wait
    an additional second to make sure the SD card can finish its
    wear-levelling tasks and write actions. You can now safely unplug the
    Raspberry Pi. Failure to shut the Raspberry Pi down properly may corrupt
    your SD card, which would mean you would have to re-image it.
